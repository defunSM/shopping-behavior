# shopping-behavior

This project is a exploratoration of shopping data based on users who have seen the promotion and those who have not. The purpose of the exploration is to determine if there is any difference between the two groups in their purchasing behavior.

## Observations 

One of the observations from the data is that the shoppers tend to be on the younger than older indicated my the right skew. We are also able to determine that there is a difference in shopping behavior between the promotion group and non promotion group. The promotion group spent on average 20 more dollars than the non promotion group. Our t-test p-value helped us reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the non-promotional and promotional group. We also notice that the promotional group is more likely to leave a review almost 15% more likely than the non-promotional group.
